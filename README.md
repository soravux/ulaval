##Local Install

>Note this is for a mac os x env. it should work under another *nix based distro but I can't say if it will work for a windows env. because I haven't tested it. 

Step 1

Installing Telescope (web wrapper)

```bash
git clone git@github.com:TelescopeJS/Telescope.git
```

Step 2

Installing Meteorite (web framework) we will need npm for that

If you don't have npm there you go

```bash
curl http://npmjs.org/install.sh | sh
```

then install meteorite

```bash
npm install -g meteorite
```

Step 3 

cd into the apetrend dir  

run 

```bash
meteor
```

Step 4

Sign up to get an admin account

Enjoy !
